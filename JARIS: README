**JARIS** is a symbolic intelligence engine that decodes, transforms, and simulates language and data using rule-based logic, graph theory, and machine learning. It combines acronym processing, dynamic transformation systems, and time-based simulations to model and predict system behavior — especially in domains involving finance, control systems, and constructed reality.

## Core Features

### 1. Symbolic Transformation Engine
- Encodes text using a triadic letter-to-number mapping.
- Vowel-based flow control (Start Gates).
- Supports contextual command/action sets and transformation layers.

### 2. Acronym Intelligence Framework
- Auto-detects and encodes acronyms.
- Graph links based on usage, context, and temporal relationships.
- Tracks influence, cycles, and system impact.

### 3. Graph-Based System Modeling
- Graphs capture cause-effect relationships and system cycles.
- Analyzes symbolic dominance, feedback loops, and reset conditions.
- Tools: PageRank, cycle detection, centrality measures.

### 4. Simulation Engine
- Time-step simulations and event queue modeling.
- Models feedback, cascading triggers, and phase shifts.
- Used to test theories in control, finance, and survival logic.

### 5. Learning and Feedback Loop
- Reinforcement learning applied to transformation weight tuning.
- A/B testing and unsupervised discovery of latent patterns.
- Feedback directly modifies edge weights and transformation logic.
